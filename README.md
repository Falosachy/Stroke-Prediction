# Stroke-Prediction
Predict stroke risk from routine clinical data (age, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking). This pipeline cleans and imputes missing values, encodes categorical features, balances classes with SMOTE, and trains Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models. Evaluation uses accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROCâ€‘AUC.
